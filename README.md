# MaxPoolin_Verilog_CNN
 Max Pooling is a pooling operation that calculates the maximum value for patches of a feature map, and uses it to create a downsampled (pooled) feature map. So, you can observe that in the top leftmost corner, from the 2x2 submatrix having entries “12 20 8 12”, 20 is taken as output since it is the maximum out of this 2x2 submatrix.
